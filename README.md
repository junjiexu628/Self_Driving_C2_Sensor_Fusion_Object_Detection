# Self_Driving_C2_Sensor_Fusion_Object_Detection

## 1, Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (EKF, track management, data association, camera-lidar sensor fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?
Step 1: 
## 2, Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)?
## 3, Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?
## 4,Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
